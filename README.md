# SK-17-Automation-Java: Learning & Practice Repository

## Overview

This repository contains Java code solutions developed as part of a learning journey in an automation course. The code examples and implementations reflect key Java concepts and techniques learned throughout the lectures. The focus is on reinforcing core Java programming skills, with an emphasis on object-oriented programming (OOP) and its practical applications.

## Goals

- **Understand Java syntax and core concepts**: Build a strong foundation in Java through practice and coding.
- **Demonstrate Java knowledge**: Showcase Java code solutions that apply key concepts from the lectures.
- **Prepare for automation and testing**: Develop the necessary skills for automation tasks and testing scenarios using Java.

## Topics Covered

1. **Lecture 02**: *Introduction to Java and IntelliJ IDEA*  
   Overview of Java, working with IntelliJ IDEA, primitive data types, and variables.

2. **Lecture 04**: *Operators and Expressions, Conditional Statements*  
   Learn about operators, expressions, and how to use conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`, etc.) in Java.

3. **Lecture 05**: *Loops in Java*  
   Explore loop structures like `for`, `while`, and `do-while` to iterate over data in Java.

4. **Lecture 06**: *Data Structures*  
   Introduction to basic data structures such as arrays and lists.

5. **Lecture 07**: *Advanced Data Structures*  
   Study advanced data structures like sets, maps, and queues.

6. **Lecture 08**: *Methods in Java*  
   Learn how to define and invoke methods, along with understanding method parameters and return types.

7. **Lecture 09**: *Classes and Objects in Java*  
   Delve into object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, including static and non-static fields and methods, constructors, and class definitions.

8. **Lecture 10**: *Exception Handling*  
   Learn about Java's exception handling mechanisms, types of exceptions, and handling them effectively using `try`, `catch`, `finally`, and `throws`.

9. **Lecture 11**: *Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)*  
   Explore key OOP concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and how to implement them in Java.

10. **Lecture 12**: *OOP Part II*  
    Learn more about OOP with abstraction, encapsulation, interfaces, and abstract classes.

11. **Lecture 13**: *Practical Application of OOP Principles*  
    Apply OOP principles in real-world coding scenarios, integrating concepts from previous lectures.

## Repository Structure

- **Code Solutions**: Each lecture package contains Java code solutions that demonstrate how to apply the concepts discussed during the course.

## Future Updates

- **Modifications**: This repository is a snapshot of my learning at a particular point in time. I may return to refine or enhance my solutions as my understanding of Java deepens.
